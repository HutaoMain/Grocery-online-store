6. Payment Gateway: The site should support multiple payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and other popular payment gateways.
7. Order Management: The website should be able to manage orders, track shipments, generate invoices and manage returns, refunds, and cancellations.
8. Security: SSL encryption, secure payment gateway, and other security features should be in place to protect sensitive customer data.
