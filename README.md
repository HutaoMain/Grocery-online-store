1. User-Friendly Navigation: A simple, intuitive and easy-to-use navigation menu is critical to ensure visitors can quickly and easily find what they’re looking for.
2. Product Categories and Search: Customers should be able to search for products based on categories, brands, or any other criteria that are relevant to the products you offer. A well-organized catalog with a search feature is a must.

4. Shopping Cart: This is where customers can review their purchases, add or remove items, apply discounts, and proceed to checkout.
5. Checkout Process: This should be simple and secure. It should include a form for shipping and billing information, payment options, and order confirmation.
6. Payment Gateway: The site should support multiple payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and other popular payment gateways.
7. Order Management: The website should be able to manage orders, track shipments, generate invoices and manage returns, refunds, and cancellations.
8. Security: SSL encryption, secure payment gateway, and other security features should be in place to protect sensitive customer data.
