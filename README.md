Need to fix:

1. responsiveness
2. Category in ProductPage
3. if first time register or logging in, the backend should have boolean object 0 and 1, if 0 then first time logging in, it will ask then to fill up the shipping address if 1 then it will not ask and will redirect to home after logging in.
4. delete product in the api

5. click category, show the products under // done
6. Bug in category initial state null // done
7. Profile page
8. change footer
9. Topbar change
10. check checkout // done
